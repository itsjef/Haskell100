# 100 days of Haskell

This repo may be slow because it is created for people like me who also have other things to do beside learning Haskell all day. You should write notes for what you have done everyday in one folder.

Rules are simple:
  - Lecture material is consisted of 12 weeks.
  - Each week, read the lecture reading and everything that is recommended in the reading.
  - Also, do the homeweek on one day of the week and make sure to do the bonus question.
  - Since week 12 is about monads and it is really hard, you should spend the last 20s days to read about it.
  - Everyday, do problems from the daily problem website.
  - Last day is to wrap up whatever you have done and celebrate!
